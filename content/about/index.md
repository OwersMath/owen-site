I am graduate student in mathematics currently studying at Rutgers University. I graduated in May 2022 with my Bachelor's in Mathematics at New York University. My interests include real analysis, functional analysis, differential geometry, and the philosphy of mathematics.  I am also interested in analytic philosophy and Orthodox Christian Theology. These are my two beloved dogs Piper and Molly. Piper is a red heeler mix, and Molly is a blue heeler Australian Cattle Dog.
