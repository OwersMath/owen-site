My mathematical interests lie in geometric analysis and differential geometry. Specifically, my research is concerned with the analysis of singularities of energy minimizing maps
and geometric flows. In geometric analysis, the question of the uniqueness of tangent maps
is notoriously opaque, and is the subject of much modern research. My thesis consists of
two parts, the first of which focuses on the analysis of harmonic maps following the pioneering work of Leon Simon[1]. Here, I explicate the theory of singularities and tangent maps
of energy minimizers on Riemannian manifolds.
