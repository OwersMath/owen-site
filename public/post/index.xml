      <description>The Basel Problem, named after Leonard Euler&amp;rsquo;s hometown of Basel, Switzerland, is the solution to the infinite series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\pi^2}{6}\)Euler was the first to publish his solution one year after having solved this problem in 1734. Since Euler&amp;rsquo;s solution, many alternative proofs have been offered, using complex analysis, symmetric polynomials, and so on. These alternative proofs are more rigorous than Euler&amp;rsquo;s liberal use of infinite polyomial tails, but Euler&amp;rsquo;s solution is perhaps the most elegant.</description>
