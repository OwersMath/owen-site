      <description>We will evalute the integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{ln(x)}{1+x} dx \)using Taylor Series expansion and switching the order of integration and summation.
Firstly, we notice that $$ \frac{1}{1+x}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n x^n $$
by taylor series expansion. This series coverges for \(x \in (0,1)\)so we can substitute this into the integral:
$$ \int_0^1 \frac{ln(x)}{1+x} dx = \int_0^1 ln(x) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n x^n dx $$
Further, by changing the order of integration and summation, we have $$ \int_0^1 ln(x) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n x^n dx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \int_0^1 x^n ln(x) dx $$</description>

      <title>Basel Problem</title>

      <description>The Basel Problem, named after Leonard Euler&amp;rsquo;s hometown of Basel, Switzerland, is the solution to the infinite series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\pi^2}{6}\)Euler was the first to publish his solution one year after having solved this problem in 1734. Since Euler&amp;rsquo;s solution, many alternative proofs have been offered, using complex analysis, symmetric polynomials, and so on. These alternative proofs are more rigorous than Euler&amp;rsquo;s liberal use of infinite polyomial tails, but Euler&amp;rsquo;s solution is perhaps the most elegant.</description>
